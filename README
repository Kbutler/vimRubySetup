tar file for vim setup.

contains:
1. .vimrc
2. DCT/engines -- uses pathogen to install vim repos from Github
3. DCT/files   -- files that I need for my vimSetup. Change this to what is required.
4. .vim/autoload -- contains the pathogen.vim to do downloads
5. .vim/bundle   -- vim files are coied to here

uses:
1. Based on http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogenwith the variable file list removed from static engine.
2. Sync machines
3. My repository of vim files. Other users may have a different file list

To use it:
Note .vim/bundle was emptied of all downloaded files first.
Created with tar -cvf vimRubySetup.tar .vimrc ./DCT/ .vim/
Extract with tar -xvf vimRubySetup.tar
cd ~/DCT/engines
ruby vim-update.rb ../files/vim-packages
Download GVim and run.

Notes::
Engine is separate from files, so DCT/files/vim-packages is my personal setup. If this is used then change the file list as to what you require. But it does provide a setup for using GVim with Rails 3.
